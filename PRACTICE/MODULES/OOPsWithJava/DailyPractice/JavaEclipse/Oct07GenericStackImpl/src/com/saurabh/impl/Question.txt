Task: Implement a generic stack class called GenericStack<T>. The stack should support the following operations:
push(T item): Add an item to the top of the stack.
pop(): Remove and return the item at the top of the stack.
peek(): Return the item at the top of the stack without removing it.
isEmpty(): Check if the stack is empty.
size(): Return the number of items in the stack.
