Question 1 (Medium): Employee Management System
Scenario:

Create an interface Employee with methods calculateSalary() and displayDetails().
Create abstract classes SalariedEmployee and HourlyEmployee implementing Employee.
Implement calculateSalary() in each class based on their specific pay structure.
Create concrete classes Manager, Developer, Intern, and Consultant extending the appropriate abstract classes.
Create custom exceptions InvalidSalaryException and InvalidHoursException for invalid salary or hours worked.
Task:

Implement try-catch-finally blocks to handle potential exceptions during salary calculation.
Use upcasting and downcasting to demonstrate polymorphism in the system.
Test the system with various input values to ensure proper exception handling.
