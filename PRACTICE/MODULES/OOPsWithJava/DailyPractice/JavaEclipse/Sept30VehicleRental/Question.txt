Question 2: Vehicle Rental System

 * Create an interface called Vehicle with methods rent() and returnVehicle().

 * Create abstract classes Car and Bike implementing the Vehicle interface.

 * The Car class should have a rentPerDay attribute and the Bike class should have a rentPerHour attribute.

 * Implement the rent() and returnVehicle() methods in the concrete classes.

 * Create concrete classes Sedan and SportsCar extending the Car class, and Scooter and Motorcycle extending the Bike class.

 * Override the rent() and returnVehicle() methods in the concrete classes if necessary.

 * Create a VehicleRentalSystem class to manage the rental of different vehicles.
