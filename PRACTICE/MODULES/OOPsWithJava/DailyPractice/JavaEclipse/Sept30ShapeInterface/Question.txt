Question 1: Shape Hierarchy

 * Create an interface called Shape with methods calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter().
 
 * Create abstract classes Circle and Rectangle implementing the Shape interface.
 
 * The Circle class should have a radius attribute and the Rectangle class should have length and breadth attributes.
 
 * Implement the calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() methods in the concrete classes using their respective formulas.
 
 * Create concrete classes RegularCircle and Square extending the Circle and Rectangle classes, respectively.
 
 * Override the calculateArea() and calculatePerimeter() methods in the concrete classes if necessary.
 
 * Create a ShapeTester class to test the different shapes and their areas and perimeter.
