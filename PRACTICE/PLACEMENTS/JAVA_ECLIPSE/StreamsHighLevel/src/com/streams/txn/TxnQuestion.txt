Question:
You have a list of transactions where each transaction contains:

transactionId (unique ID for the transaction)
customerId (ID of the customer who made the transaction)
amount (amount spent in that transaction)
Task:
Write a Java Stream to find the first customer who has made at least n transactions and has spent a total of at least x amount across all their transactions.

Example Data:
List<Transaction> transactions = List.of(
    new Transaction(1, 201, 200),
    new Transaction(2, 202, 150),
    new Transaction(3, 201, 100),
    new Transaction(4, 203, 50),
    new Transaction(5, 202, 300),
    new Transaction(6, 201, 150),
    new Transaction(7, 201, 100),
    new Transaction(8, 203, 200)
);

Test Case:
Input:
n = 3, x = 400
Expected Output:
201
(Customer 201 has 4 transactions and has spent total 550, which satisfies n=3 and x=400)

Hint:
Use groupingBy to collect transactions by customerId, then filter based on count and sum
